## Purpose

This project allows users to see who their federal and local representatives are based on their address.

## Motivation
We wanted to create a project that would allow us to see some of our representatives and show us different information about them. The application displays the bills that the user's representatives are introducing in Congress, their representative's contact info, and their Twitter feeds.

## Features

The application takes a user's address and finds their representatives by using Google Civic API. The application can access the representative's bills through the ProPublica API.
