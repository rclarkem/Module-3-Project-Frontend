## Usage

This project allows users to see who their federal and local representatives are based on their address.

## Motivation
We wanted to create a project that would allow us to see some of our representatives and show us different information about them. The application displays the bills the user's representatives are introducing in congress, that representative's contact info, and their Twitter feeds.

## Features

Takes a user's address and finds there representatives by using Google Civic API. The application can access the representative's bills through access from the ProPublica API.
